//! Reachable, check if a Target is currently available or not.
//!
//! A "Target" is everything that implements the Target trait, used to
//! check if, a resource is currently available. This crate offers a ICMP and TCP based Target
//! usable to check, if a computer is available over the network.
//!
//! Additionally this crate contains asynchronous utilities to execute these checks regularly
//! within a given time interval.
